#Cloud-Based High-Throughput Genomic Data Analysis
Overview:

This project implements a cloud-based pipeline for analyzing RNA-seq (FASTQ) data using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
The pipeline leverages scalable cloud resources, containerization, and workflow automation to efficiently process high-throughput sequencing datasets.

Key features:

Supports RNA-seq FASTQ input data.

Automated pipeline using Nextflow/Snakemake.

Scalable deployment on Google Cloud (Compute Engine, Kubernetes, Life Sciences API).

Reproducible environments using Docker containers.

Benchmarking of performance and cost between local vs. cloud execution.

 Problem Statement:

Traditional local systems struggle to process large RNA-seq datasets due to limited computational power, storage, and reproducibility issues.
This project solves these challenges by building a cloud-native genomic analysis pipeline on GCP.

 Objectives:

Build a complete RNA-seq analysis workflow: QC → Alignment → Quantification → Differential Expression.

Containerize tools (FastQC, Trim Galore, STAR/Hisat2, featureCounts/Salmon, DESeq2/edgeR).

Deploy the pipeline on Google Cloud for scalability.

Benchmark execution time and costs.

 Tools & Technologies:
